🌧️ Rain Prediction Model
This repository presents a machine learning-based solution to predict rainfall using meteorological and environmental data. The project leverages standard data science practices including EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation to build a robust rain prediction system.

📘 Notebook: Rainpredict.ipynb
Total Code Cells: 72

Markdown Notes: Guidance for splitting modeling steps if needed

Built using Python and common ML libraries

🎯 Objective
To accurately predict whether it will rain tomorrow using various weather-related features. This is a classic binary classification problem, commonly used in weather forecasting applications.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Pandas & NumPy – for data loading and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for exploratory data visualization

Scikit-learn – for model training and evaluation

Pickle – for model serialization

📈 Modeling Approach
Preprocessing and cleaning weather data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and trends

Feature selection and transformation

Model training using classification algorithms

Evaluation using:

Confusion Matrix
